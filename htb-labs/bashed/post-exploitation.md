## üß† Post-Exploit Insights

### üéØ What did you learn from this host?

- This is a well-structured Active Directory environment vulnerable to common enumeration techniques.
    
- Misconfigurations such as exposed SMB shares and user SPNs enable foothold and escalation through classic Windows AD attack chains.
    

### üîÄ Did you discover lateral movement potential?

- Yes. BloodHound analysis and enumeration of SPNs (e.g., `winrm_svc`, `ca_svc`) suggest viable attack paths toward other domain-joined systems or elevated users.
    
- KeePass ZIP and possible GPP exposure hint at credential reuse or service-specific creds.
    

### üöÄ What privilege escalation worked?

- The primary escalation vector is **Kerberoasting** (still pending successful hash extraction due to time skew errors).
    
- Access to **BloodHound** recon and **valid domain credentials** provides groundwork for further privesc using AD object manipulation (`GenericAll`, `WriteDACL`, etc.).
