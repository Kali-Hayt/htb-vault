## 🧠 Hacking Log - 2025-05-27

## 🗓 Date  
Tuesday, May 27 2025

## 🕒 Time Started  
00:57:58

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- nmap

## 🔍 Target / Lab  
- fluffy (10.10.11.69)

## 📋 Commands Run
```bash
nmap -p- -T4 -Pn 10.10.11.69
```

## ✅ Learning Detected

- HTB boxes may expose **no ports** until after a reset (and even then may delay port binding)
- `nmap -p- -Pn --min-rate=1000` is essential for **deep recon**
- **GitHub Push Protection** blocks private key commits — critical safety layer
- **`git filter-repo`** is required to fully remove secrets from history
- `.gitignore` should exclude `loot/` or sensitive folders
## ✅ Results

 - No open ports found (all TCP ports filtered)
 - Fluffy was reset at 01:41 PDT
- Box still did not expose any services post-reset

```plaintext

```

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Full port scans are essential when top-port scans fail
- Machines may need time post-reset before services bind
- GitOps hygiene is critical when working with loot and credentials

## ❓ Follow-ups

- Retry Fluffy with another reset and scan after 2–3 mins
- Try another easy box (e.g. `blue`, `bashed`) in parallel
- Automate target IP capture in `htball` after spawn
