## 🛠 Tools Used  
- nmap

## 🔍 Target / Lab  

- **HTB Machine:** _fluffy_

- IP:** 10.10.15.72 (VPN), 10.10.11.69 (internal)

## 📋 Commands Run
```bash
nmap -p- -T4 -Pn 10.10.15.72
```

## ✅ Learning Detected

- Strengthened workflow using `-Pn` to bypass unreliable ping responses in HTB environments.
-
- Reaffirmed value of full TCP port scan early in recon.

## ✅ Results

- Identified open ports for further enumeration.
    
- Mapped network structure, leading to discovery of services including SMB and potential Kerberos exposure.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Clock skew in Kerberos environments is a persistent issue — verifying both system and hardware clocks is essential.
    
- Don't overlook value in auxiliary files in ZIPs (e.g., KeePass plugins or logs).


## ❓ Follow-ups

- Retry Kerberoasting after syncing system and hardware clocks.
    
- Explore KeePass ZIP for embedded or disguised credentials.
    
- Scan SYSVOL for GPP misconfigurations and credentials.
    
- Complete BloodHound analysis with newly collected data.
