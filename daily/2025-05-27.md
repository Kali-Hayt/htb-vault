## 🛠 Tools Used  
- nmap  
- telnet

## 🔍 Target / Lab  
- meow (10.129.107.206)  
- blue (10.10.10.40)

## 📋 Commands Run
```bash
# Meow
nmap -p- -T4 -Pn 10.129.107.206
telnet 10.129.107.206
cat /flag.txt

# Blue
nmap -p- -T4 -Pn 10.10.10.40
```

## ✅ Learning Detected
- Telnet with no authentication access
- Port 23 open can lead directly to flag
- Learned to fuzz with FFUF (blue setup)

## ✅ Results

### Meow:
- Port 23 (telnet) open
- Connected without password
- Flag: HTB{meow_flag_here}

### Blue:
- Port scan completed (no further recon yet)

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Don't skip low ports like 23 and 21
- Use `-p-` to catch weird open services
- Logging manually is better than broken scripts

## ❓ Follow-ups
- Build telnet auto-connect script
- Continue blue box enumeration
- Try fuzzing login page on blue
